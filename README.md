# Cyp6 cluster UGS

Haplotype analyses of the CYP6 cluster in *Anopheles gambiae* samples from Uganda (UGS), using Ag1000G Phase 1 data.

Outputs are in these folders:

* `haplotype_analysis_28jun19.html` or `.ipynb`: python notebooks with code & analyses
* `haplotype_analysis_output`: all figures and tables related to the haplotype cluster and positive selection analyses.
* `haplotype_phylogeny`: phylogenies of haplotypes using variants in the cluster (using IQTREE). Results in newick (`.treefile`) & pdf.

Default cluster names are not very informative -- here's what they actually are:

* `cluster_0`: a cluster of UGS haplotypes carrying duplications, ZZB, P4 mutations etc.
* `cluster_1`: a wt cluster of UGS haplotypes, that doesn't have any interesting mutation 
* `cluster_no`: all other haplotypes are put in this group

All other folders and files are used for input/metadata/etc.
